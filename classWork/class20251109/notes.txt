Detecting a cycle in a linked list can be achieved using various methods, 
with the most common and efficient being Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, 
also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm.

Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare):
Initialize Pointers: Create two pointers, slow and fast, 
both starting at the head of the linked list.

Traverse at Different Speeds:
Advance the slow pointer by one node at each step (slow = slow.next).
Advance the fast pointer by two nodes at each step (fast = fast.next.next).
Check for Meeting Point: In each iteration, 
check if slow and fast pointers are pointing to the same node.
If slow == fast, a cycle is detected, and the function returns true.

Handle End of List: If the fast pointer (or fast.next) reaches null before slow and fast meet, 
it means there is no cycle in the linked list, and the function returns false. 
This occurs when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, indicating a linear structure.

What is cache?
Types of cache
 - external
 - in process
 - cdn
 - client side cache
Architecture of cache
1. cache aside
    App server -> cache(Redis cache), db
    - Cache hit or cache miss
    - if cache miss, APP itself hits the db. fetches the data and put it to cache and return to user.
    -  time taken is little longer if cache miss happens.
2. Write through
    App server -> writes to cache  -> then synchronize to db real time.
3. Write behind
    App server -> writes to cache. but saving to db happens asynchronously
4. Read through
    App server, cache, db.
    -> check cache and return if found.
    -> if not found, cache will read from db and return the response.

Cache eviction Policy:
----------------------
 - Memory is small and cache can become full.
 - FIFO - First in First out
    - first written record will be evicted first.
    - Least used eviction policy.
 - LRU - Least Recently used.
    - we may not need it anymore, hence removed.
 - LFU - Least Frequently used.
 - TTL - Time to live
    - We maintain time to live and remove it if that TTL expires.

LRU In depth and designing.

Linked List advantages: Deletion is easier operation.
